######################## 
# Usbkill behavior commands:

# whitelist
# sleep
# log_file
######################## 

# Whitelist command lists the USB ids that you want whitelisted
# How to get the correct usbid for your trusted USB device?
# BSD/Linux: run "lsusb", the usbid will looks like this: 0123:9abc
# Mac OS X: run "system_profiler SPUSBDataType" in the terminal and find the Vendor/Product ID, it will looks like this:
# > Product ID: 0x8403
# > Vendor ID: 0x05ac  (Apple Inc.)
# Take the 4 characters after the 0x and merge them (Vendor ID first), it will look like: 05ac:8403
# Be warned! Other parties can copy your trusted usbid to another usb device!
# use whitelist command and single space separation as follows:
# whitelist = ["4c2a:d2b0", "0b2d:a2c4"]
# To allow multiple (2 and 4) USBs with same id: [ {"4c2a:d2b0":2}, {"0b2d:a2c4":4}] or
# [ "4c2a:d2b0","4c2a:d2b0", "0b2d:a2c4", ..., "0b2d:a2c4" ] (be consistent)
keylist = []

# allow for a certain amount of sleep time between checks, e.g. 0.25 seconds:
sleep = 0.25

# Log file location:
log_file = /var/log/usbkill/usbkill.log


######################## 
# Usbkill destruction commands:
# N.B: all these commands are executed in the following order.

# kill_commands
# do_sync
######################## 

# Custom kill commands that can not be specified using above described mechanisms.
# This is where you want to release volumes, etc.
# These commands will run in order and as root, as the last commands.
# Sync should be activated once more if you want to sync 
# Use " not ' to define the strings, e.g.:
# kill_commands = [ "bash ~/scripts/destroy.sh", "sync" ]
kill_commands = [ ]

# Should usbkill sync the file system for you?
# This should not be a problem on most computers.
# Sync will save some of your work to disk before killing your computer.
do_sync = True
